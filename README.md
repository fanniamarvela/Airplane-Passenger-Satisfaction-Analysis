# Airplane Passenger Satisfaction Analysis

In this project, I will position myself as a data analyst in an airline company where I will formulate a series of questions based on the business needs and potential issues faced by the company related to Airline Passenger Satisfaction data. I will answer these questions through data analysis, narratives and visualizations, and then present insights from the analysis that stakeholders can use as a basis for business decision-making.

The data analysis I will conduct focuses on U.S. airline companies aiming to understand passenger satisfaction levels after flights and the factors influencing satisfied and dissatisfied passengers with airline services. The analysis will involve examining the satisfaction levels of passengers who feel satisfied, neutral, or dissatisfied in general, and identifying factors affecting passenger satisfaction based on survey results, passenger segmentation, and flight histories. With the information obtained, the company can identify areas of passenger satisfaction that need improvement and gain insights for the development of future flight services to enhance customer loyalty.
