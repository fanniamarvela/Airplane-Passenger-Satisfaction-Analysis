# Airplane Passenger Satisfaction Analysis

In the highly competitive aviation industry, every company strives to differentiate itself from competitors to attract customers. Passenger experience plays a crucial role in shaping consumer preferences and decisions when choosing an airline. Understanding and improving passenger satisfaction is essential, as it directly impacts customer loyalty, financial performance, and overall brand reputation.

An airline in the United States aims to analyze passenger satisfaction through customer satisfaction surveys to assess how well the services provided meet passengers' expectations. The goal is to identify the factors influencing passenger satisfaction in relation to their flight experiences.

In my role as a Data Analyst for this project, I will formulate a series of questions based on the business needs and potential challenges faced by the company related to Airline Passenger Satisfaction data. I will answer these questions through data analysis, narratives and visualizations, and then present insights from the analysis that stakeholders can use as a basis for business decision-making.

The data analysis will focus on Unites States airline companies, aiming to understand the satisfaction levels of passengers after flights and the factors influencing satisfied and dissatisfied passengers. The analysis will evaluate passenger satisfaction levels categorized as satisfied, neutral, or dissatisfied in general and identify key factors influencing passenger satisfaction, based on survey results, passenger segmentation, and flight histories. With the insights obtained, the company can identify areas of passenger satisfaction that need improvement and gain valuable information for the development of future flight services to enhance customer loyalty.
